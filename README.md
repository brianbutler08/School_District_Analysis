# School_District_Analysis

# Overview

For this project, we were approached by Maria, a data analyst for a large school district. One of her responsibilities is to work with all standardized test data, preparing it for analysis, reporting and presentation purposes. She was looking for assistance to specificically look at school funding and student standardized test scores. We were granted to access to the district dataset and proceded to aggregate the applicable data in order to showcase trends in school performance. Our analysis was intended to assist the superintendent and school board to make informed decisions around school funding and priorities setting.

However, once the project was effectively completed, we were approached by Maria to make some adjustments to our analysis. There was evidence to suggest that the reading and math scores for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School had been unethically altered and they needed to be removed from our analysis. We therefore replaced the impacted scores with null values and re-ran all of our analyses without those values. 

There were two datasets that we utilized during this analysis and they were combined into a single set for ease of aggregation. The fields contained in the final database included:

- Student ID
- Student name
- Student gender
- Student grade
- School name
- Standardized math score
- Standardized reading score
- School ID
- School type
- School size (number of students)
- School budget

# Results

By replacing the standardized test scores of ninth grade students at Thomas High School with a null value, we anticipated that there may be some changes in the overall outcomes realted to the analysis. In order to attempt to quantify these changes, we wanted to directly compare our original DataFrames with the DataFrames that were produced after the removal of the suspicious scores.
